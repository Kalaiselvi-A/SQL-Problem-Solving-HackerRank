# SQL Problem Solving – HackerRank

This repository contains my SQL solutions to selected HackerRank problems, created as part of continuous practice and interview preparation.

The intention of maintaining this repository is to document my approach to solving SQL problems in a clear and understandable way. Each solution focuses not only on getting the correct output, but also on explaining the logic used to arrive at the query.

## About this work

SQL is a core skill for many software and data-related roles. While practicing problems on HackerRank, I felt the need to maintain a structured record of my solutions along with explanations that reflect real understanding.

This repository serves as:
- A personal learning record
- A revision source for SQL concepts
- A reference for interview preparation
- A shared resource for learners who want to understand SQL logic

## Organization of the repository

Problems are grouped based on their category:

>SQL-Problem-Solving-HackerRank\
├── Basic Select/ [01-20]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_# Simple SELECT queries to get started_\
├── Advanced Select/ [21-25]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_# Complex SELECT queries with conditions_\
├── Aggregation/ [26-42]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _# Queries using GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc._\
├── Basic Join/ [43-50]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _# Simple JOIN operations between tables_\
├── Advanced Join/ [51-55]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _# Complex JOIN queries with multiple tables_\
├── Alternative Queries/ [56-58]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _# Different ways to solve the same problem_\
└── README.md&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _# This documentation file_

Each problem is documented in a separate markdown file for clarity.

## How solutions are presented

Every solution includes:
- The **problem title** along with the official **HackerRank problem link**
- A **brief explanation** of the problem statement
- The **SQL query**, written in a clean and readable format
- A **logical explanation** describing how the query works

The explanations are written in **simple and clear language** to ensure better understanding and to make SQL revision efficient.

---

## Concepts practiced

- Filtering and sorting data
- Aggregate functions and grouping
- JOIN operations
- Subqueries
- Conditional logic using CASE
- String and date functions

The difficulty level increases gradually from basic to advanced.

## Ongoing updates

This repository is updated regularly as part of my SQL practice.  
The focus is on consistency and clarity rather than quantity.
